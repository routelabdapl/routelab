    title: "About Me"
    image: "/about/me_cisco_live.jpg"
    content: |-
      I am a network engineer with a passion for automation. I studied computer science and started my journey as a network guy early in my career.

      While studying I learnt a lot of things about Linux too, which I can now successfully adapt with new technologies emerging as we move into a more programmable age of network engineering.

      Apart from my job I am a huge music addict. You will encounter me while listening to some heavy music most of the time. I also play guitar a bit and recently started with photography as another hobby.
